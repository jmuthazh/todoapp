Application Developed in Spring Boot

#Project Name:#
Todo Application

#Problem Statement:#
Workfront Engineering Take-Home Assessment

We would like you to build a To-Do list application. With this application, I should be able to create various lists of work items. For example, I could create a grocery list, a home repair list, or a list of books to read. I should be able to add or remove items from any list at any time. I should also be able to mark items complete.

We are intentionally leaving the requirements vague, as we would like to see what you come up with. If you would like to include functionality that we haven’t explicitly cited, you are very welcome to do so. Feel free to use whatever languages/technologies/solutions you would like (although we would recommend incorporating the skills for the position you have applied for). This application needs to be available for us to use in our interview. That could mean you make a public-facing website and a GitHub repository, or you could bring your computer, or you could come up with a different solution. You will not simply demo your work to us, but rather we will actively use it and ask you about it while we talk with you (we don’t want to just watch you use it). We will also want to see all of your code.

You will be asked about various aspects of your solution, such as scalability, performance, code quality, development process and user experience. There are no right or wrong solutions. We only ask that you be prepared to talk about what you did and why you did it.
